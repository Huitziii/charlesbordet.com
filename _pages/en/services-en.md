Need a data scientist to analyze your data?

My clients hire me for:

* [Statistical analysis & Machine learning](#statistical-analysis-and-machine-learning)
* [Building automatic reports & dashboards](#building-automatic-reports-and-dashboards)
* [Professional training in R and Statistics](#professional-training-in-r-and-statistics)

I have worked with:

<div class="text-center">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/services/renault-logo.png" | absolute_url }}" width="150px" style="margin: 20px">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/services/bcg-logo.png" | absolute_url }}" width="150px" style="margin: 20px">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/services/emma-logo.jpg" | absolute_url }}" width="150px" style="margin: 20px">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/services/formation-bigdata-logo.jpg" | absolute_url }}" width="150px" style="margin: 20px">
	<img src="{{ "/assets/images/services/cargomedia-logo.png" | absolute_url }}" width="150px" style="margin: 20px">

</div>

## Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning

I help my clients extract value from their data. For example:

**<span class="tooltip">LCV<span class="tooltiptext">Lifetime Customer Value</span></span>**: How to predict the conversion rate and subscriptiong duration of a new user for a SaaS product.

**Behavioral analysis** of patients suffering from Vitiligo (a skin disease) in order to better understand the factors impacting the severity of the disease.

**Incidentology studies**: Goal is to quickly assess the seriousness and cost of product issues to quickly take actions.

Visit the [Projects]({{ "/en/projects" | absolute_url }}) for more.

Coming from a background in mathematics and statistics, I have later completed my theoretical knowledge by starting a PhD in statistics.

Then, I kept developing new skills to first master **R** and then **Python**, while diving into **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** which are topics I have created courses for and consistently write about in my blog.

## Building automatic reports & Dashboards

<div class="text-center">

	<a href="{{ "/assets/images/services/mds.png" | absolute_url }}"><img src="{{ "/assets/images/services/mds.png" | absolute_url }}" width="250px" style="margin: 30px"></a>
</div>

Setting up statistical models and KPIs tracking lead to a continuous monitoring of the indicators and of the model predictions. That's why my clients usually need to set up all kinds of dashboards.

With R Shiny, I create easy-to-use and interactive dashboards that update the charts and tables automatically as soon as new data is detected. We can:

* create interactive tables (similar to Excel)
* visualize data with customized charts
* extract PDF reports or Excel working files.

A huge strength of using R Shiny compared to dashboard-in-a-box services is the ability to completely customized it to your needs. They're also easy to maintain and completely automatic. They fetch the data in a database on a regular basis or by the click of a button and update all the KPIs, charts, etc.

Since they use R as a backend, the data is cleaned and prepared with powerful code that can handle millions of data points in a few seconds.

R Shiny is particularly convenient for internal use in a team, to track daily KPIs, interact with the data, or visualize prediction models.

## Professional training in R and Statistics

I like to teach so I create online courses. So far, I have been able to gather more than 2000 students with these courses (in French):

* [Apprendre la Data Science avec R](https://www.udemy.com/datascience-r/?couponCode=WEBSITE)
* [Le Deep Learning de A à Z](https://www.udemy.com/le-deep-learning-de-a-a-z/?couponCode=WEBSITE)
* [L'Intelligence Artificielle de A à Z](https://www.udemy.com/intelligence-artificielle-az/?couponCode=WEBSITE)

I occasionally conduct professional trainings in Statistics or R. Here are a few examples (in French):

* [Les fondamentaux des statistiques appliquées](https://www.ib-formation.fr/catalogue/nbs-details/catref/universib-formations-informatiques-informatique-decisionnelle-les-fondamentaux/ref/bi090/les-fondamentaux-des-statistiques-appliquees)
* [Les fondamentaux de l'analyse statistique avec R](https://www.ib-formation.fr/catalogue/nbs-details/catref/universib-formations-informatiques-informatique-decisionnelle-les-fondamentaux/ref/bi103/les-fondamentaux-de-lanalyse-statistique-avec-r)
* [Analyse statistique avancée avec R](https://www.ib-formation.fr/catalogue/nbs-details/catref/universib-formations-informatiques-informatique-decisionnelle-les-fondamentaux/ref/bi104/analyse-statistique-avancee-avec-r)
