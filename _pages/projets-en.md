## Client projects

Here are presented the most important client projects I have worked on.

### R Shiny Developer for the Boston Consulting Group (2018)

My role has been to create and maintain an R Shiny app for BCG's client, a clothing retailer, allowing them to consult and improve sales prices.

Price predictions were made from a machine learning model and fed into the dashboard, so that the merchandisers could extract and use these optimal prices.

Since the combination of AI and human expertise allow for even better results, the app was made in order to interact with the predictions, make simulations with new prices, and directly integrate these modifications in their internal systems.

*R, Shiny, HTML/CSS, Azure, Bitbucket, JIRA*

### Text mining studies in Political Sciences (2018)

I am working closely with [Daniel Finke](http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/id%2835814d4e-3b95-4fcf-9672-9ea94c9dadb7%29.html), from the Department of Political Science of the Aarhus University, in Denmark, and helped at multiple occasions to:

* extract text data from the internet (such as resolution drafts from the UN, proposals to the European Commission, etc.)
* analyze the data with text-mining algorithms (clustering, topic modelling, similarity scores, etc.)

*R (tidyverse, rvest, httuv, multiprocessing), AWS (EC2, S3), text-mining (LDA, semantic similarity)*

### Statistical model for the expected lifetime value (2016 - 2017)

I created a machine learning model to predict the value of new users on a dating website.

The model predicted the conversion rate (from free to paid user) and the duration of the subscription. Once the lifetime value known, the marketing team was able to optimize the acquisition cost of new users.

*Machine Learning/Statistics (logistic regression, elastic net, survival analysis)*, R (data.table, survival, Shiny), AWS (EC2, Redshift), SQL*

### Web scraping of etsy.com (2017) (and others)

I did multiple web scraping jobs, whose goal is to extract data from a website. The challenges are to work around scraping protections, extract dynamically-generated data, or parallelize tasks when the quantity of data to extract is huge.

*R (tidyverse, rvest)*

### Incidentology studies and automatisation of reports/dashboards (2015 - 2017)

I worked at Renault where I developed new skills to:

* Automate repetitive tasks with R scripts
* Create automatic reports with R Shiny
* Present incidentology studies

## Academic Projects

### Statistical studies in Dermatology (2018)

I have worked closely with [EMMA](http://emma.clinic/) and participated in studies targeting patient care for patients suffering from skin disease, such as Vitiligo, Acne, or Eczema. 

Publications have been submitted.

*R, Multivariate regression, ANOVA, PCA*

### Web applications (2018)

[Udemy](https://shiny.charlesbordet.com/udemy) is a visualization dashboard to analyze my revenues from Udemy.

Being rather disappointed by the tools provided by the platform, I decided to create my own dashboard.
