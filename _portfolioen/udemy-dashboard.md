I created a dashboard to track and analyze sales from my Udemy courses.

[Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/) is a marketplace where you can sell and buy online courses about any topic.

In November, 2017, I decided to give it a try and publish my first course.

I kept working at it and have now (2018 October) three published courses on the platform.

With more than 4000 students, I'm starting to see the potential of the platform. The revenue grows steadily with the publication of new courses.

But..

How to optimize my time with Udemy?

Especially:

* How can I sell my courses at a higher price? Udemy uses very agressive marketing strategies and each sale brings between $1 and $5 per student. I would like to increase the value per student.
* How to decrease Udemy's revenue share per sale? Each sale brings 50% of the total price to Udemy if *they* bring the student. But the student comes from a channel I own (my website, for instance), I keep 97% of the total price.
* What is the impact of my marketing efforts?

The major issue I'm facing is that Udemy's dashboard is rather poor in terms of KPIs. I can't answer these questions.

That's why I decided to build my own dashboard by using the raw data provided by Udemy.

This dashboard has been created with R Shiny and the `shinydashboard` library. It is available here: [https://shiny.charlesbordet.com/udemy/](https://shiny.charlesbordet.com/udemy/)
